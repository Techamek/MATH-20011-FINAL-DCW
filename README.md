ggplot2::diamonds: analysis example

Introduction
• Describe the dataset. What is the dataset about?
• If possible, comment on the study design (observational study vs. experiment), target popula-
tion, sampling strategies, potential bias and confounding factors, etc.

Specific questions
• What research questions would you like to answer using the dataset? (You may need to
perform some exploratory data analysis to identify and refine the questions.)
• How would you like to answer the questions in a statistical framework?

Data analysis
• Use statistical inference to analyze the data.
• You need to check necessary conditions before applying an inferential procedure.
• If the conditions are not met, you may perform simulation instead.
• Document the data analysis process.

Results
• Present the data analysis results.
• Interpret the results in a way to address the research questions.

Conclusion
• Discuss the scope of the analysis. Does the analysis answer the research questions? Is there
any limitation?
• To fully answer the questions and/or gain a better understanding of the studied topic, what
datasets might be useful? What additional variables would you recommend to measure?

How large the sample should be? Considering the feasibility, how should the sample be
obtained?
